<p align="center"> HELLO MY NAME IS TATI! My favorite animal is a llama!!  A fun fact about me is that I made it to varsity volleyball and track my freshmen year, but the following year I decided to try tennis instead of volleyball!</p>

<p align="center"> In today's project, I was able to play around with different ways to light up bulbs/. I leanred the differences betweeen circuits in parallel as well as circuits in series. Resistance slows down the current so that the current would not burn up. Voltage is the energy that is given off by a power source like batteries.
