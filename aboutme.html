<p align="center"> In today's project, I was able to play around with different ways to light up bulbs/. I leanred the differences betweeen circuits in parallel as well as circuits in series. Resistance slows down the current so that the current would not burn up. Voltage is the energy that is given off by a power source like batteries.
